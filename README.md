## Cloning the Repository and Running the Build Script

1. **Create a Linode or any other cloud VM:**
   - Choose your preferred cloud service provider and create a new virtual machine. 
   - Ensure you have SSH access to the VM.

2. **SSH into your VM:**
   - Open your terminal or command line interface.
   - Connect to your VM using SSH:
     ```sh
     ssh username@your-vm-ip-address
     ```

3. **Clone the repository:**
   - Once connected to your VM, clone the repository from GitHub:
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/destinyfkrr/Cybersecurity-Club-LNBTI.git
     ```

4. **Navigate to the relevant session folder:**
   - Change directory to the session folder you want to set up:
     ```sh
     cd Cybersecurity-Club-LNBTI/session-folder-name
     ```

5. **Make the build script executable:**
   - Use `chmod +x` to give the build script executable permissions:
     ```sh
     chmod +x build_script.sh
     ```

6. **Run the build script:**
   - Execute the build script to set up your environment:
     ```sh
     ./build_script.sh
     ```

You are now ready to use the VM for your CTF challenges. Share the IP address with everyone, and they can start enumerating and attacking it, submitting their answers and flags to the private TryHackMe room. As the CTF host, you can publicly display the scoreboard so that everyone can view it and compete against each other.
