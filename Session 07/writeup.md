### Recon
We ran an `nmap` scan as usual to check the open ports in this machine before attacking :

```

```

We found that :
- Port 80 runs `Apache httpd 2.4.41` Webserver
- Port 139,445 runs `Samba smbd 4.6.2` 

To enumerate Port 80, we used a web browser and visited the ip address of the machine and was able to see a website :

Since we saw that port 80 was open, We ran a Gobuster scan to look for any hidden directories so we can visit it. We were able to see two new directories as `/developer`.

```

We visited the `/development` directory and was able to see a `dump.txt` file:
![Image2](assets/image2.png)

While reading it, we were able to see that it was a MySQL dump and contained some credentials. However, since we didn't have any MySQL ports open, we couldn't use it yet.
![Image3](assets/image3.png)

### Samba

We then used those credentials to access the SMB Port, We used `smbclient` to view the available shares and was able to use the credentials we found earlier and access .
```
┌──(dest1ny㉿kali-linux-2022-2)-[~]
└─$ smbclient -L //45.33.55.121 -U chami 
WARNING: no network interfaces found

        IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (localhost server (Samba, Ubuntu))
```

We then connected to the smb share `LNBTI` as the user `chami` using the below command. We were then able to find a `backup.txt` file. We used the `get` command again and downloaded the file to our local machine and exited the service.:
![Image4](assets/image4.png)

We then again used the `cat` command to see the contents inside the file, And we were able to get the password of the user `chami` . so we used ssh to login into chami  :
```
┌──(dest1ny㉿kali-linux-2022-2)-[~]
└─$ cat backup.txt 
SMB Backup Completed on 8.02.2024 : chami:blahblahblah : Ubuntu Linux 20LTS
```

We were then able to grab the user flag and a Mysql credentials just as from the dump we found eariler :

![Image5](assets/image5.png)

We had a question saying to find a file named `findmeifucan.txt` in our questions. So we used the `find` command with the `-name` tag to search for the file and was able to see that it inside a hidden directory and we used the `cat` command to view the contents of the file.

Note : In linux systems, Hidden files has a `.` in front of the file name. 

```
chami@localhost:~$ find / -name "findmeifucan.txt" 2>/dev/null
/home/chami/.backup/findmeifucan.txt
```

 Here's a breakdown of the command `find / -name "findmeifucan.txt" 2>/dev/null`:

1. **`find`**: This is the command used for searching files and directories within a specified directory hierarchy.

2. **`/`**: This specifies the starting point of the search. In this case, `/` denotes the root directory, meaning the search will start from the root of the filesystem and traverse downward.

3. **`-name "findmeifucan.txt"`**: This is an option for `find` that specifies the name of the file to search for. In this case, it's searching for a file named "findmeifucan.txt". The `-name` option is used to match filenames using shell-style wildcards, so `"findmeifucan.txt"` is the exact filename being searched for.

4. **`2>/dev/null`**: This part of the command deals with error handling. 
   - `2>`: This redirects the standard error stream (file descriptor 2).
   - `/dev/null`: This is a special device file that discards all data written to it.

```
chami@localhost:~$ cat /home/chami/.backup/findmeifucan.txt
LNBTI{G00d_j0b_f1nd1ng_m3}
```

### Privilege Escalation
We checked the active ports using the command `ss -tuln` and were able to see that port 3306 (MySQL) is open locally (You can find this using Linpeas too).
![Image6](assets/image6.png)

We connected to the mysql service using the username `root` and password `password` and was able to grab the flag and the password of the root :
```mysql
chami@localhost:~$ mysql -u root -p                                
Enter password:                                                     
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.

We were able to use the `su` command and switched into the `root` user and grab the root flag:

Optional : We can use ssh to login into the `root` user too by using the command :

```
ssh root@{MACHINE_IP}
```
